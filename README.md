Many new things to learn and play with.

- [dapy-ai](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/intro/): a framework for algorithmically optimizing LM prompts and weights.
    - comments: not that useful, most of features are covered by OpenAI's API.
    - this example from [haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/cookbook/prompt_optimization_with_dspy) might worth a look.
- [OpenAI Cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/): a collection of practical examples and tutorials for working with OpenAI's APIs.
    - comments: very useful!
    - OpenAI has its own evaluation framework, which is very useful for optimizing prompts, see the [link](https://github.com/openai/evals/tree/main)
